In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that
satisfies the heap property: If A is a parent node of B then key(A) is ordered
with respect to key(B) with the same ordering applying across the heap. Either
the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the
children and the highest key is in the root node (this kind of heap is called
max heap) or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the
children and the lowest key is in the root node (min heap). Heaps are crucial
in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, and in the
sorting algorithm heapsort.
